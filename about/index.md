<h1>About <a href="url fn">Trent Strong</a></h1>
<img class="profile" src="/images/profile.jpg" width="150" height="200" title="photo profile" />

I am currently a <span class="role">software engineer</span> living in <span class="locality">Los Angeles</span>.

Computers &mdash; and at some point, the internet &mdash; have been a part of my life since I was really young.  
I was drawn into the fold by the mystique of pointers, the radix sort, attempting to build a MUD <sup id="reference-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> and checking out the Doom source<sup id="reference-2"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> at
some point in junior high.  As luck would have it, my high school also had great labs for basic analog and digital electronics,
which eventually led me into electrical engineering and then to physics at Texas A&amp;M. 

Before I decided to build things every day, I did graduate research in high energy physics.  I focused mainly on trying to make sense of the particles flying away from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma">Quark Gluon Plasma</a> using computer simulation, lots of math, and pretty much everything but the kitchen sink.  I decided that the postdoc to professor path was a bit too narrow for all the other things I wanted to fit in my finite life, I packed my bags for California and haven't looked back. 

I am a firm believer in the power of neuroplasticity.  From my limited experience it seems that learning new concepts that are orthogonal to what you already know
has the strange side-effect of making you stronger on all fronts.  On that note, I would consider myself an aspiring generalist.

Interests (in wildly fluctuating order):
-----------------------------------

* Building good software, that works correctly and efficiently
* Ambitious products that move the needle a bit
* Applied Math - especially topics form machine learning like SVD, ensemble methods, heuristic problem solving
* Embedded programming, 3D printing, CNCs, that whole shebang 
* Bicycles 
* Skateboards 
* Teaching folks that they're smart, and capable of learning technical skills 

Languages I have a soft spot for:
---------------------------------

* Python
* Clojure - and functional programming as a whole.  Haskell from the typed side seems interesting too.
* C
* I think C# is a nice language, and hopefully Mono makes it useful outside of the Microsoft ecosystem.
