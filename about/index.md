I am a <span class="role">software engineer</span> currently living in <span class="locality">Los Angeles</span>.

Technical geekery has been a part of my life since I was really young.  
I was drawn into the fold by the mystique of pointers in C, the radix sort, attempting to build a MUD <sup id="reference-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> and checking out the Doom source<sup id="reference-2"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> at
some point in junior high.  As luck would have it, my high school also had great labs for basic analog and digital electronics,
which eventually led me into electrical engineering and then to physics at Texas A&amp;M. 

I did graduate research in high energy physics. I focused mainly on trying to make sense of the particles flying away from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma">Quark-Gluon Plasma</a> using computer simulation,
lots of math, and pretty much everything but the kitchen sink. Even though I did well and still enjoyed physics, I dropped out to avoid the narrowing stairsteps of&nbsp;academia.

I am a firm believer in the power of neuroplasticity.  From my limited experience it seems that learning new concepts that are orthogonal to what you already know
has the strange side-effect of making you stronger on all fronts.  On that note, I would consider myself an aspiring generalist. 

You can always reach me by <a class="email" href="mailto:trenton.strong@gmail.com">email</a>, <a href="skype:trenton.strong?chat">Skype</a>, <a href="xmpp:trenton.strong@jabber.org">Jabber</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/trentonstrong">Twitter</a>.

Most of my open source contributions these days flow through my <a href="https://github.com/trentonstrong">Github</a> account.  It's not as much as I would like, but I'm always trying to change that.

Interests (in wildly fluctuating order):
-----------------------------------

* Building good software, that works correctly and efficiently
* Ambitious products that move the needle a bit
* Applied Math - especially topics from machine learning like SVD, ensemble methods, heuristic problem solving
* Embedded programming, 3D printing, CNCs, that whole shebang 
* Bicycles
* Skateboards 
* Teaching folks that they're smart, and capable of learning technical skills 

Languages I have a soft spot for:
---------------------------------

* Python
* Clojure - and functional programming as a whole.  Haskell from the typed side seems interesting too.
* C
* C# is a nice language and I had a good run with it, but I'd rather not be bound to a single platform implementation.
